  "project_overview_content": "This project aims to establish an integrated monitoring platform at the Mind Lake of National Taipei University to tackle pressing environmental sustainability challenges, including air pollution, water contamination, and flooding. By utilizing a LoRa-IoT (Internet of Things) system, the platform will monitor air quality, water quality, and water levels. It will also incorporate advanced deep learning techniques to develop predictive models that enhance the forecasting of environmental conditions. Additionally, an early warning system will be implemented to alert the community about potential risks related to air and water quality, as well as water levels. The initiative aspires to create a transparent and user-friendly dashboard that provides real-time information, thereby increasing public awareness and response capabilities to environmental changes. Ultimately, this project seeks to promote sustainable development and reduce risks to life safety and property.",
